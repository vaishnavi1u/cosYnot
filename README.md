# cosYNOT BMSCE

**Predict the flood. Protect the future.**

India-focused urban flood **digital twin**: a FastAPI simulation engine plus a React control room. The home view is a **Live Flood Map** — satellite imagery of real Indian river / valley corridors, with engine-computed water painted on top as the event unfolds.

This is **not** a weather map, **not** an official forecast, and **not** an AI black box. Water levels come from a deterministic discrete-time water-balance model in one Python file.

**Live demo:** [https://bmsce-hack-vaishnavi.vercel.app](https://bmsce-hack-vaishnavi.vercel.app)  


---

## What it does

1. **Where** flooding happens — neighbourhoods along real corridors (Bellandur–Varthur, Mithi, Adyar, Yamuna, …).
2. **When** a place becomes critical — **ETTC** (estimated time to critical).
3. **Why** it floods — runoff, drainage, inflow / outflow, elevation.
4. **What** you can change — pumps, drainage, greener surfaces, ponds, relief channels.

Named Indian cities are **inspirational twins**: OSM-style locality names and SRTM-style relative elevations on a 12×12 grid, overlaid on real satellite terrain. They are **not** GIS reconstructions or IMD/NDMA forecasts.

Historical events (Bengaluru 2022, Delhi 2023, Chennai / Michaung 2023, Mumbai 2024, and others) are **contextual references** only.

## Features

| Area | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Live Flood Map** | Leaflet + Esri World Imagery; flood canvas + flowing river overlay from the engine |
| **City twins** | Bengaluru, Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Ahmedabad, Pune, Guwahati (+ custom = Bengaluru frame) |
| **Risk Analysis** | Places aggregated by neighbourhood name: risk, water %, ETTC, exposed people, elevation |
| **Early Warning** | Priority list of localities the engine flags first |
| **Flood Lab** | Six canned infrastructure / rainfall cases |
| **Intervention Lab** | Before / after packages (drainage, pumps, green cover, ponds, channels) |
| **Math Model** | Equations and risk weights served from the backend |
| **Scenario Comparison** | Side-by-side rainfall / failure cases |
| **India Cases** | Documented Indian flood events as narrative context |
| **Stay Safe** | NDMA / NIDM public flood-safety steps, kit, helplines, city tips |

The top bar keeps a **city selector** and **Run flood**. The frontend never invents flood numbers; it only displays API results.

## Architecture

```
React (Vite) control room
        │  /api  proxy
        ▼
FastAPI  (api/index.py on Vercel)
        ▼
FloodSimulator
  ├ RainfallModel
  ├ Runoff     Qr = C × P × A
  ├ Drainage   D  = min(avail, Cap × η)
  ├ Flow       F  = K · max(0, Hi − Hj)
  └ Water balance → risk → ETTC → alerts
```

Mathematics live in **`backend/app/services/math_model.py`**. City locality grids live in **`backend/app/data/places.py`**. Map frames (bbox, river, lakes) live in **`frontend/src/lib/indiaGeo.ts`**.

---

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| UI | React 18, TypeScript, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS 3 |
| Map | Leaflet, react-leaflet, Esri World Imagery tiles |
| Charts / motion | Recharts, Framer Motion |
| Icons | Lucide |
| API | FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic v2 |
| Numerics | NumPy |
| Tests | pytest, httpx |
| Hosting | Vercel (static `public/` SPA + Python serverless `api/index.py`) |

Python **3.11 or 3.12** is required (see `.python-version`). Python 3.14 often cannot install the pinned `pydantic-core` / NumPy wheels.

## Run locally

You need **two terminals**: API on port **8765**, UI on port **43217**. Vite proxies `/api` to FastAPI.

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
python3.11 -m venv .venv          # or python3.12
source .venv/bin/activate         # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
```

- App: [http://127.0.0.1:8765](http://127.0.0.1:8765)
- OpenAPI: [http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8765/docs)
- Health: [http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/health](http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/health)

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

UI: [http://127.0.0.1:43217](http://127.0.0.1:43217)

### 3. Tests

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest -q
```

### Production-style frontend build

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploy (Vercel)

The repo is wired for a **hybrid** Vercel project:

- `installCommand` / `buildCommand` in `vercel.json` build the Vite app into `public/`
- Python function `api/index.py` serves FastAPI; `/api/*` is rewritten to that function
- Function timeout is 60s; `backend/**` and `data/**` are bundled with the function

Redeploy from the GitHub connection, or:

```bash
npx vercel --prod
```

Public URL: [https://bmsce-hack-vaishnavi.vercel.app](https://bmsce-hack-vaishnavi.vercel.app)

Do not commit `.env`, credentials, or `.vercel` auth files.

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"city":"bengaluru","scenario":"heavy","duration_hours":3,"delta_t_minutes":5}'
```

## Equations (source of truth)

Replace functions in `backend/app/services/math_model.py` to change the entire product.

- **Balance:** \(W(t+\Delta t)=W+(Q_r-D+F_\mathrm{in}-F_\mathrm{out})\Delta t\)
- **Runoff:** \(Q_r=C\times P\times A\) (P converted mm/hr → m/min)
- **Head / flow:** \(H=z+h,\quad F_{ij}=K_{ij}\max(0,H_i-H_j),\quad K=C_\mathrm{flow}A_\mathrm{conn}/L\)
- **Drainage efficiency** falls as water % rises (1.00 / 0.85 / 0.60 / 0.40)
- **ETTC** = first simulated time water % ≥ 100
- **Risk** = 0.35 WL + 0.20 rise + 0.15 drainage + 0.15 elevation + 0.10 rain + 0.05 infra

## Locked demo numbers

Engine run: **Bengaluru synthetic twin · seed 42 · Heavy monsoon · 3 hours · Δt = 5 min**. Simulation outputs, not city measurements.

| | BEFORE (current infrastructure) | AFTER (Protect hospital package) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Critical zones | **23** | **4** |
| Peak water | **223.9%** | **150.2%** |
| Population exposed | **49,477** | **21,427** |
| First critical event | **85 min** | **125 min** |
| Hospital risk | **80.9 / 100** | **61.5 / 100** |
| Flood duration | **100 min** | **60 min** |

Mass-balance residual **−0.001 m³ (0.000%)**.

Protect hospital package = drainage ×1.5 + hospital pumps 28 m³/min + 15% greener C + 8,000 m³ pond storage + open relief channel.

cosYNOT BMSCE is a simulation and decision-support prototype

- Synthetic scenarios are **not** official forecasts, inundation maps, or emergency warnings.
- Satellite view shows **real terrain**; flood colour is **engine water**, not observed flood GIS.
- Historical Indian flood events are for **context**, not replay of measured hydrographs.
- In a real flood, follow **police, fire, NDRF/SDRF, municipal, IMD, and NDMA** instructions — not this screen.
